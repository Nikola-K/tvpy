What
----

Software written in python using qt/pyside for UI that parses pages that contain links to websites that allow you to stream the video and extracts direct links to files that you can watch in your default video player. No ads. No flash. No dependencies.


How
---

The code, for now, parses watchseries.lt in background for links to videoweed.es which hosts the actual files. The idea is to add more hosts and indexes, but for first version that should be enough.


Legality
--------

The code does not contain links to any video files, it's equivalent of using your web browser to stream videos.

Legality of that varies from country to country. Look it up before using the software.
